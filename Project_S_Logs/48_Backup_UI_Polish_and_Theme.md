**Status:** ✅ Merged to `main`

## Context

Following the core functionality fixes in Log 47, the Backup tab required a "premium" UI polish and architectural alignment with the rest of the dashboard (specifically the Metrics page) to ensure a seamless user experience for the v1.0 release.

## Enhancements Applied

### 1. Theme Alignment (Metrics Sync)
The Backup page was redesigned to mirror the **Metrics** page layout patterns:
- **Header:** Standardized with small title and "Real-time · 5s refresh" subtext.
- **Stat Pills:** Added a horizontal row of high-level metrics (Total Storage, Last Run Age, Snapshot Count, Host Disk Usage).
- **Card Design:** Transitioned to `bg-secondary/5` cards with 11px uppercase `SectionHeader` components.
- **Data Density:** Refined table padding and font sizes to match the high-density "Containers" list on the Metrics page.

### 2. Loading UX (Skeletons)
- Integrated `@/components/ui/skeleton` into the initial data fetch flow.
- Table rows and status fields now pulse during the first load, eliminating layout shifts and providing immediate visual structure.

### 3. Mobile-First "Card List"
- Replaced the rigid desktop table with a responsive **Card View** for screens smaller than 768px.
- Each backup now stacks as a detailed card with Snapshot ID, Status, Size, and Service pills, optimized for vertical scrolling on mobile devices.

### 4. Dual-State Progress Bar
- Implemented a smart progress indicator in the "Create Snapshot" card.
- **Phase 1 (Preparing):** Pulsing indeterminate state while containers are being paused.
- **Phase 2 (Compressing/Encrypting):** Simulated 0-95% progress bar providing real-time feedback during the long-running Restic capture process.

### 5. Storage Visualization
- Added a real-time **Host Disk Usage** gauge.
- Integrated with the `/api/stats` endpoint to show the current root filesystem state.
- **Color Logic:** Emerald (<70%), Amber (70-90%), and pulsing Rose (>90%) to proactively warn of potential backup failures due to disk space.

### 6. Empty State Illustration
- Replaced the "No snapshots found" text with a professional empty state.
- Features a centered database icon with a soft glow, a friendly call-to-action message, and a direct "Run First Backup" button.
