# Getting Started

*A collaborative project building a unified, self-hosted digital hub platform.*

This repository contains the implementation plan, product definition, technical feasibility analysis, and documentation for Project S — a self-hosted operating system for the home server that integrates the best open-source tools into a single, easy-to-manage interface.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

To start the entire Project S ecosystem with a single command, use the `boom.sh` script (recommended for Mac) or the specialised installation scripts below.

**Option A: The "Boom" Script (Mac / Local)**

```bash
chmod +x boom.sh
./boom.sh
```

Creates `.env` automatically, detects your LAN IP, builds, starts all services, and launches your browser. Use this for day-to-day restarts.

To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

**Option B: The "Install" Script (Linux / First-Time Setup)**

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Creates `.env` automatically, detects your LAN IP, starts all containers, installs Nextcloud Hub apps (Calendar, Contacts, Office, Talk), and configures Nextcloud Office (Collabora). Run this once on a fresh clone.

> Nextcloud Office is auto-configured on every subsequent container start via `config/nextcloud/setup-office.sh`. No manual steps needed after the first install.

**Option C: Manual Docker Setup**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your passwords, then:
docker compose up -d
```

> `boom.sh` and `install.sh` handle `.env` creation automatically. Only use this option if running `docker compose` directly.

## 🔄 Update & Rollback

Before updating any services, run the pre-update check:

```bash
bash scripts/pre-update-check.sh
```

To safely update all services (creates backup first, validates it, then applies):

```bash
bash scripts/update.sh
```

If an update breaks something, rollback to the latest backup:

```bash
bash scripts/rollback.sh
```

> The update script automatically aborts if the backup fails. Your current setup is never touched until a valid backup is confirmed.

---

## 🔐 First-Time Security Setup

After the containers are running, the dashboard requires a one-time setup before it can be used.

### Step 1 — Matrix Synapse secrets

`boom.sh` and `install.sh` auto-generate these on first run. If you're using **Option C (manual `docker compose`)**, add them to `.env` manually:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32   # run three times — one value per variable
```

```env
MATRIX_REGISTRATION_SECRET=<generated>
MATRIX_MACAROON_SECRET_KEY=<generated>
MATRIX_FORM_SECRET=<generated>
```

These are injected into `config/matrix/homeserver.yaml` at container startup. Never reuse values between installations.

### Step 2 — Dashboard entropy key & admin account

1. Open `http://localhost:3069` — you will be redirected to `/setup` automatically
2. Move your mouse over the canvas to generate a unique 128-character encryption key
3. **Copy and store this key somewhere safe** — it encrypts your entire database; it cannot be recovered if lost
4. Choose a username and a strong password (minimum 12 characters) to create your admin account
5. You will be logged in automatically and redirected to the dashboard

> The entropy key is derived from mouse movement + CSPRNG (SHA-512). It is stored AES-256-GCM encrypted on disk and used to derive the database encryption key, session secret, and WebSocket secret via HKDF-SHA512. It never leaves the server.

### Step 3 — Subsequent logins

Navigate to `http://localhost:3069` and log in with the admin credentials created in Step 2. Additional user accounts (with `viewer` role) can be created from the dashboard admin panel.

## 📦 Integrated Services

All services are proxied through nginx at `http://<LAN_IP>:<port>`. Internal services (databases, Ollama) are not directly accessible.

| Service | Description | Port |
|---|---|---|
| Nginx Reverse Proxy | Single entry point for all services | `:8088` |
| Main Dashboard | Project S control panel | `:8088` / `:3069` |
| Jellyfin | Media & entertainment server | `:8096` |
| Nextcloud | Cloud productivity & file management | `:8081` |
| Nextcloud Office (Collabora) | Document editing — auto-configured on start | `:9980` |
| Theia IDE | Browser-based IDE with terminal & Docker access | `:3030` |
| Matrix / Element | Secure, encrypted self-hosted chat | `:8082` |
| Vaultwarden | Password manager (Bitwarden-compatible) | `:8083` |
| Open-WebUI | Local AI chat interface (connected to Ollama) | `:8085` |
| Kiwix Manager | File browser for uploading `.zim` files | `:8086` |
| Kiwix Reader | Offline knowledge base (Wikipedia, etc.) | `:8087` |
| OpenVPN UI | VPN client management interface | `:8090` |
| OpenVPN Server | Self-hosted VPN | `:1194/udp` |
| Ollama | Local LLM inference engine | *(internal only)* |

---

## 🛠️ Adding New Services

To add more applications to the ecosystem:

1. **Docker** — add the service to `docker-compose.yml` and assign it to the correct network (`frontend` for user-facing, `backend` for internal services, `database` if it needs a DB)
2. **Nginx** — add a proxy block to `config/nginx/nginx.conf` with the service's internal port
3. **Launcher** — add the app to the `applications` array in `welcome-section.tsx`
4. **Metrics** — add the app's metadata to the `appMeta` object in `app/page.tsx` if you want it tracked in the metrics tab
5. **Startup config** — if the service requires Nextcloud app settings (e.g. a WOPI URL), add an `occ` command to `config/nextcloud/setup-office.sh` — it runs automatically on every container start

# Project Overview

---

## What is it?

Project S replaces expensive, data-harvesting cloud subscriptions (Google Drive, Office 365, Netflix, 1Password...) with self-hosted, open-source alternatives running on hardware you own — a Raspberry Pi, an old PC, or a VPS.

Install once. Get a private, encrypted, modular platform that runs your digital life.

**Core principles:**
- **Unified** — one login, one dashboard, one update system
- **Private** — encryption keys you control, nothing leaves your network
- **Modular** — install only what you need, add more later
- **Simple** — no command line required for day-to-day use

---

### Network Topology

| Network | Services |
|---|---|
| **frontend** | nginx, dashboard, element, openvpn-ui, kiwix-manager, open-webui |
| **backend** | jellyfin, nextcloud, collabora, theia, synapse, vaultwarden, kiwix, ollama, openvpn |
| **database** | MariaDB (Nextcloud), Postgres (Synapse) — internal only |

Each service runs in its own Docker container. Project S handles networking, shared data volumes, and service health monitoring so you don't have to.

---

## Security Model

Project S is built encryption-first. The dashboard uses a layered security stack:

### Authentication
- **One-time setup wizard** — first launch redirects to `/setup` where mouse movement entropy generates a 128-character hex key; admin account is created in the same flow
- **iron-session v8** — encrypted, signed HTTP-only cookie sessions (`homeforge_session`)
- **Argon2id password hashing** — 64 MiB memory, 3 iterations; credentials never stored in plaintext
- **Role-based access** — `admin` and `viewer` roles; privileged API routes protected by `requireAdmin()`
- **Middleware guard** — all dashboard routes redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated

### Encryption & Key Derivation
- **Entropy key** — mouse movement combined with CSPRNG, hashed via SHA-512 (Web Crypto API), produces a 128-character hex key
- **HKDF-SHA512** — `SESSION_SECRET`, `WS_SECRET`, and `DB_KEY` are all derived from the entropy key at runtime; never hardcoded or stored in `.env`
- **SQLCipher via `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`** — the SQLite user database is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest
- **Pre/post-setup rekey** — database opens with a temporary UUID-derived key before setup; `PRAGMA rekey` transitions to the entropy-derived key once setup completes

### Rate Limiting & WebSocket Security
- **Sliding-window rate limiter** — login endpoint allows 10 attempts per username per 15 minutes; returns `X-RateLimit-*` headers
- **WS ticket auth** — terminal WebSocket connections require a short-lived HMAC-SHA256 ticket (`GET /api/auth/ws-ticket`); tickets expire after 30 seconds
- **PTY idle timeout** — terminal sessions auto-close after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Container allowlist** — WebSocket shell access is restricted to explicitly whitelisted container names

### Container Security
- **Log rotation** — all 15 services use `json-file` driver with `max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 3` (prevents disk exhaustion)
- **Healthchecks** — every service has a healthcheck; dashboard monitors all containers
- **Network segmentation** — three Docker networks (`frontend`, `backend`, `database`); databases are isolated with `internal: true` (no internet access)
- **Memory limits** — each service has a memory cap to prevent resource starvation

### Secrets Management
Runtime secrets (`SESSION_SECRET`, `WS_SECRET`, `DB_KEY`) are derived from the entropy key at startup — they are never written to disk or `.env`. Infrastructure secrets are now stored in `data/secrets/` (Docker Secrets):

| Variable | Used by |
|---|---|
| `mysql_root_password` | Nextcloud MariaDB |
| `mysql_password` | Nextcloud MariaDB, Synapse Postgres |
| `nextcloud_admin_password` | Nextcloud admin account || `collabora_password` | Collabora Online admin |
| `matrix_registration_secret` | Synapse federation registration |
| `matrix_macaroon_secret_key` | Synapse macaroon tokens |
| `matrix_form_secret` | Synapse CSRF protection |
| `webui_secret_key` | Open-WebUI session signing |
| `vpn_admin_password` | OpenVPN UI admin account |

Run `bash scripts/migrate-secrets.sh` to automatically generate secret files from your `.env` or generate new random secrets.
